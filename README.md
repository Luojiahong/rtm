rtm
===

rtm is a Python package for reverse time migration (RTM) of infrasound signals. Infrasound waveform data are back-projected over a grid of trial source locations. Based upon previous work by Sanderson et al. (in review) and Walker et al. (2010), this implementation is flexible and applicable to a wide variety of network geometries and sizes. Realistic travel times can be incorporated from numerical modeling or atmospheric specifications.

...and their dependencies, which you don't really have to be concerned about if
you're using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)!

It's recommended that you create a new conda environment to use with this
repository:
```
conda create -n rtm -c conda-forge -c conda-forge/label/dev cartopy fiona gmt=6 obspy utm xarray
```

Usage
-----

To use rtm, clone or download this repository and add it to your Python path,
e.g. in a script where you'd like to use rtm:
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/rtm')
```
Then you can access the package's functions with (for example)
```python
from rtm import define_grid
```
and so on. Currently, documentation only exists in function docstrings. For a
usage example, see [`example.py`](example.py).

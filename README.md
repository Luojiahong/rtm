_rtm_ is a Python package for locating infrasound sources using reverse time
migration (RTM). Infrasound (or seismic) waveform data are back-projected over
a grid of trial source locations. Based upon previous work by Sanderson et al.
(in press) and Walker et al. (2010), this implementation is flexible and
applicable to a wide variety of network geometries and sizes. Realistic travel
times can be incorporated from numerical modeling or atmospheric
specifications.

Installation
------------

It's recommended that you install this package into a new
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment
containing all of the packages listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies)
section.

To create a new conda environment for use with _rtm_, execute the following
terminal command:
```
$ conda create -n rtm -c conda-forge cartopy gdal obspy utm xarray
```
This creates a new environment called `rtm` with all published _rtm_
dependencies installed. In addition to published packages, _rtm_ requires the
[_waveform_collection_](https://github.com/uafgeotools/waveform_collection)
package.

To install _rtm_, first activate the `rtm` environment with
```
$ conda activate rtm
```
and install the dependency _waveform_collection_ into this environment
(instructions
[here](https://github.com/uafgeotools/waveform_collection#installation)).

Then execute the following terminal commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uafgeotools/rtm.git
$ cd rtm
$ pip install -e .
```
The final command installs the package in "editable" mode, which means that you
can update it with a simple `git pull` in your local repository. This install
command only needs to be run once.

Dependencies
------------

_uafgeotools_ repositories:

* [_waveform_collection_](https://github.com/uafgeotools/waveform_collection)

Python packages:

* [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/)
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)
* [ObsPy](http://docs.obspy.org/)
* [utm](https://github.com/Turbo87/utm)
* [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)

...and their dependencies, which you don't really have to be concerned about if
you're using conda!

Optional (for automatic DEM downloading):

* [GMT 6](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/) (install by following
  the
  [official GMT install instructions](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/blob/master/INSTALL.md/))

Usage
-----

Documentation is available online
[here](https://uaf-rtm.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
